# Description

This is an NFT project where the NFT depends on the mood of the owner. The NFT could be `üôÇ` if the owner is happy and `‚òπÔ∏è` if the owner is sad

## SetUp

```
git clone https://github.com/SpringxDSay/foundry-MoodNFT-contract.git
```

### Installing OpenZeppelin Contracts Package

```bash
forge install OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts --no-commit
```

### Deploy

This will default to your local node. You need to have it running in another terminal in order for it to deploy.

```
make deploy
```

### Deployment to a testnet or mainnet

1. Setup environment variables

You'll want to set your `SEPOLIA_RPC_URL` and `PRIVATE_KEY` as environment variables. You can add them to a `.env` file.

- `PRIVATE_KEY`: The private key of your account (like from [metamask](https://metamask.io/)). **NOTE:** FOR DEVELOPMENT, PLEASE USE A KEY THAT DOESN'T HAVE ANY REAL FUNDS ASSOCIATED WITH IT.
  - You can [learn how to export it here](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015289632-How-to-Export-an-Account-Private-Key).
- `SEPOLIA_RPC_URL`: This is url of the goerli testnet node you're working with. You can get setup with one for free from [Alchemy](https://alchemy.com/?a=673c802981)

Optionally, add your `ETHERSCAN_API_KEY` if you want to verify your contract on [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/).

1. Get testnet ETH

Head over to [faucets.chain.link](https://faucets.chain.link/) and get some tesnet ETH. You should see the ETH show up in your metamask.

2. Deploy (IPFS NFT)

```
make deploy ARGS="--network sepolia"
```

3. Deploy (SVG NFT)

```
make deploySvg ARGS="--network sepolia"
```

## Scripts

After deploy to a testnet or local net, you can run the scripts.

Using cast deployed locally example:

```
cast send <RAFFLE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS> "enterRaffle()" --value 0.1ether --private-key <PRIVATE_KEY> --rpc-url $SEPOLIA_RPC_URL
```

or, to create a ChainlinkVRF Subscription:

```
make createSubscription ARGS="--network sepolia"
```

## Base64

To get the base64 of an image, you can use the following command:

```
echo "data:image/svg+xml;base64,$(base64 -i ./images/dynamicNft/happy.svg)"
```

Then, you can get the base64 encoding of the json object by placing the imageURI into `happy_image_uri.json` then running:

```
echo "data:application/json;base64,$(base64 -i ./images/dynamicNft/happy_image_uri.json)"
```
